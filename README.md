Sales Analysis Dashboard – Excel Power Pivot & DAX 
-by Marwa Riyaz

 Project Overview:
I built an interactive sales dashboard using Excel Power Pivot and DAX to analyze over 1,000 customer orders. The goal was to turn raw data into actionable business insights for revenue growth, customer behavior, and operational performance.
The project covers data modeling, KPI creation, and executive dashboard design – showing how I approach data analysis end-to-end.
Key Objectives
•	Track overall sales performance (revenue, orders, customer spend).
•	Understand seasonal trends and category performance.
•	Measure average delivery time across orders.
•	Identify top products and cities driving sales.
•	Build an executive-ready dashboard for decision making.

🛠 Tools & Methods:
•	Excel Power Pivot → data modeling across multiple tables (Orders, Customers, Products).
•	DAX Measures created for:
o	Total Revenue
o	Total Orders
o	Average Customer Spend
o	Average Delivery Time
•	Pivot Charts & Slicers for interactive filtering (Date, Occasion, City, Category).
•	Dashboard design focused on clarity and professional reporting.


  Metrics & KPIs:
•	Total Orders: 1,000
•	Total Revenue: $3.52M
•	Avg. Customer Spend: $3,520.98
•	Avg. Delivery Time: 5.53 days

  Insights I Found:
🔹 Sales Drivers
•	Occasions: Valentine’s Day, Raksha Bandhan, and Holi had the highest revenue.
•	Categories: Cakes and Soft Toys were the strongest revenue contributors.
•	Products: Gift sets and combos were consistently popular across occasions.
🔹 Customer Trends
•	Spending peaks during festive months (Feb, Aug, Sep).
•	Orders spike during morning (9–11 AM) and evening (6–9 PM).
🔹 Geography
•	Top cities included Imphal, Kovil, North Dumdum.
•	Tier-2 cities show strong growth opportunities.

  Recommendations:
•	Double down on festive occasion campaigns.
•	Expand Cakes & Soft Toys inventory and promotions.
•	Launch time-based offers during morning/evening peak hours.
•	Focus marketing budgets on top 10 performing cities while exploring growth markets.
